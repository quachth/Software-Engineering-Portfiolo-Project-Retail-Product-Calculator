# Software Engineering Portfiolo Project: Retail Product Calculator
## Author: Theresa Quach
### Description: Portfolio Project for my Software Engineering course at Oregon State University. Our assignment allowed us to design and create a program of our choice, in the language of our choice, that consists of at least once program function that is implemented via microservices architecture. My program is a calculator program that allows users to create accounts and save various products (and their production costs) locally, and receive back a calculated price at which they should sell their products to attain a desired profit for that product. The calculator program, calculator_service.py, was written by my course partner. The other two programs, UI.py and acctsrv.py, are the user interface and the account creation/login manager programs, respectively, and were written by me. 

To Run:
1. Download all files into the same directory
2. Click and run the file Retail Calculator Program.sln, which will open the project in your IDE
3. Right-click and run each program in separate processes in this order: acctsrv.py, calculator_service.py, and UI.py
    *** Note: acctsrv.py and calculator_service.py must be running for the main program to work as intended.***
4. For additional help, please refer to the Getting Started.pdf file
